<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Poor Mark drove away from the school and headed towards his house he wasent going to go to work looking like this he was 
<br>
 the most geeky looking guy he'd ever seen no fucking way am I ever going any were like this he thought as he drove up to 
<br>
 his house. The neighbor was out cutting his grass as Mark got out of his truck, &quot;Hey arent you going to work Mark?&quot; the guy 
<br>
 asked as he started to walk over to Mark, Mark was toatly mortified he didnt want anyone to see him like this, but what 
<br>
 seemed to be worse was that fact that he reconized him at all the way he was now. 
<br>

<br>
 Mark tried to make it to his door without talking to the guy but he never made it, Mark felt a big firm hand come down 
<br>
 on his now narrow shoulder and stop him in his tracks&quot;Whats up big guy you sick today Mark?&quot; Bob the neighbor asked as he 
<br>
 effortlessly turned Mark around to face him, Mark was both humiliated and mad at how easyly he was maniplated by this guy, 
<br>
 just this mourning he out weighed the guy by 40lbs easy and now he couldnt stop him from turning him round if he wanted to, 
<br>
 he was just to weak now to do anything. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;whats up Mark your fat old lady finaly going to feed you or what?&quot; Bob said laughing &quot; Hey god knows you and your son 
<br>
 both need to gain a little weight to go with your heights you know!&quot; Bob said still laughing. Marks mind was realing why 
<br>
 was this guy not shocked at how he looked now, and how'd he guess that his wife was now a fat cow, had Ty just made 
<br>
 everyone see him for what he was now. Had they totaly forgotten how he looked before, was this his fate .Now not only was 
<br>
 he tall and skinny like his son had become but now every one would be treating him like a whimp every where he went form 
<br>
 now on. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Look Bob Ive gotta get in the house man Ive got to talk to my wife! so IL.. well Ill talk to you later alright?&quot; Mark 
<br>
 said and started to head back for his door, Mark waved his thin arm in the air in a see ya later fashion and went into his 
<br>
 house, June was sitting down at the table as Mark came in, she looked exhusted her new fat body had definetly slowed her 
<br>
 down, &quot;Mark! OH GOD IS THAT YOU MARK!!&quot; June said as her now geek looking emasiated husband came into the kitchen and sat 
<br>
 across the table form his now porker wife, &quot;WHAT HAPPENED DID TY DO THIS TO YOU! OH GOD HES TURNED YOU INTO A NERD!!&quot; June 
<br>
 said as she staired at what her once handsom husband had been turned into. &quot;At leist take off those hidiuos glasses they 
<br>
 make you look even more rediculuse with them on!&quot; June said as she approched his face to take them off of him, Mark put up 
<br>
 his thin hand to stop her. &quot;NO JUNE I FUCKIN CANT SEE A THING WITH OUT THEM! DAMB IT!!&quot; Mark yelled at june she quickly sat 
<br>
 basck down and started to cry,&quot;Dont you think that I took the damb thing off already! Tys fixed it so both Dustin and me have to wear 
<br>
 these dumb glasses, he turned me and Dustin into geeks when I got them to the school, poor dustins stuck there with that 
<br>
 lunatic!!&quot; Mark said in almost a whimper. 
<br>

<br>
 The phone rang and starterld both of them Mark got up and went to answer it, &quot;Its probly my work calling me I havent 
<br>
 called them to tell them Im not going in today!&quot; Mark picked up the phone and said hello, the line was silent for a minute 
<br>
 and Mark was just about to hang up when he felt himself begging to get shorter again, &quot;Its Ty he's turning me into a kid 
<br>
 again!!&quot; Mark said as he shrank down and had to grab the waist of his jeans again. &quot;TY IS THAT YOU!&quot; Mark screamed into the 
<br>
 phone &quot;PLEase Ty dwont dwo dis two mwe pwease..&quot; Mark said in a mans tone that cracked back to a kid whiny voice as he said 
<br>
 it. 
<br>

<br>
 Mark was still gettig younger as he said it his jeans were really getting big on him and they fell around his now child 
<br>
 like legs to his ankles, his tee shirt looked like a dress on him now &quot;PWEASE NWO TWY MWE NO WANNA BWE A BWABWY!!&quot; Mark 
<br>
 said as he looked way up to were his wife was sitting, he looked to be about 3 years old now as he tryed to talk to Ty on 
<br>
 the phone, he was begging to loose control of his speach as Ty finally talked to him. &quot;ALRIGHT MARK ILL STOP MAKING YOU 
<br>
 YOUNGER FOR RIGHT NOW BUT I TOLD YOU TO GO TO WORK DIDNT I MARKY!!&quot; Ty had thrown the Marky comment in to keep Marks 
<br>
 attention. &quot;Im sworrwy Twy Pwease mwake mwe bwig agwan?&quot; Mark asked nicely 
<br>

<br>
 Mark suddeny found himself growing back up fast, so fast that he didnt have time to even pull his jeans and underwear 
<br>
 back up befor he was back to 36 years old again Ty had returned him to an adult but had changed another thing about poor 
<br>
 Mark though he wasent as tall as he was as amatter of fact he was now shorter than his wife was she had ran to where Mark 
<br>
 was standing as a 3 year old in case she had to help Mark with the phone. And now she towered over him by a leist a foot, 
<br>
 Mark reached down to pull up his jeans and was able to pull them around his waist even with the belt still buckled and the 
<br>
 jeans still zipped and buttoned. &quot;Ty Im to short you didnt get it right or something. My clothes dont fit me anymore, there 
<br>
 to big for meTy!!&quot; Mark said to Ty in a very high pitched voice he sounded like a kid now, &quot;My voice what happened to my 
<br>
 voice!! Mark said as he grabed at his throght. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;OH Ive done it right all right Mark, your a super whimp now Mark! you cant even drive your truck anymore Mark you wont 
<br>
 be able to see over the dash board any more let alone reach the peddles.!!&quot; Ty said as he laughed loudly &quot;Now give the 
<br>
 phone to June and go get the scales from the bathroom Mark! I want you to see how much you weigh now!&quot; Ty said in a strean 
<br>
 voice, Mark reluctantly handed the phone up to June who was crying openly now. Mark started to head for the bathroom, as he 
<br>
 went he was stumbling in his now to big work boots and he had to hold up his jeans as he went. Marks eyes again filled with 
<br>
 tears of frustration and anger at Ty for doing this to him, Mark picked up the scales and they felt almost to heavy for him 
<br>
 to carry in one arm and still hold up his jeans as he went. 
<br>

<br>
 Ty told June that she was going to have to drive Mark to his job now and that if he didnt go to work he would be turned 
<br>
 into the baby that he was acting like, she told Ty what he looked like now and asked how was he supposed to work at his 
<br>
 present size he couldnt do his old job before Ty had taken things further as it was. Ty told her that he had fixed things 
<br>
 at Marks job and that they would have work for him to do when he got there. only he wouldnt be in charge of a crew anymore 
<br>
 and he certainly wouldnt get paid what he use to. 
<br>

<br>
 Mark came back in to the kitchen carrying the heavy scales, he put them down in front of June and reached up for the 
<br>
 phone.&quot;Alright Ive got the scales Ty! what do you want me to do now?&quot; &quot;GET ON THEM MARK AS I TOLD YOU TO!!NOW MARK!!&quot; Ty 
<br>
 said in a commanding voice, Mark complied he didnt have a choice not to. &quot;Well Mark how much do you weigh now!&quot; Ty asked 
<br>
 politely. &quot;65LBS Ty!&quot; Mark said as his heart sank in his now tiny chest, he wasent even a hundred pounds anymore &quot;Well good 
<br>
 then I can start to change your clothes size for you then. and when your in something that fits Junes going to drive you to 
<br>
 work!&quot; Ty said as he gigled out loud. &quot;Work I cant work at the site!!Im way to small to do my job now!&quot; Mark said in a 
<br>
 shocked tone,&quot;Yes ya can my little man just go to work and they'll find you something to do trust me Mark, only ya aint 
<br>
 gonna like it though! If you would have gone in in the first place you wouldnt be in this situation now!&quot; Ty said calmly. 
<br>

<br>
 Mark felt his clothes changing to fit his now scrawny body, Marks jeans changed to a kids size 7 and his adult wookboots 
<br>
 changed in to kids boots,and for kicks Ty changed Marks tee shirt from a white one to a baby blue tee shirt with a Bugs 
<br>
 Bunny picture on it. &quot;There now yuor ready to go to work Mark.&quot; Ty said &quot;Oh god you cant make me go looking like this 
<br>
 please Ty I look like a older kid or something!&quot; Mark pleaded vainly. &quot;Well thats what ya get for disobying me in the frist 
<br>
 place Mark! NOW GO TO WORK OR ELSE!!&quot; TY said and hung up the phone on Mark. 
<br>

<br>
 Mark was begging to start to cry when his now fat wife came over and hugged him and told him what Ty said he would do to 
<br>
 him if he didnt go to work, Mark reluctantly got ready and both he and June got into the truck and June drove poor little 
<br>
 Mark to his job site. When they got there Marks boss came over and went to Junes side of the truck, &quot;Dont worry June we'll 
<br>
 take good care of Marky today so just be up here at the usaul time to get the little guy alright!&quot; Mark couldnt beleive 
<br>
 this his boss just seemed to ignore him and even called him Marky and the little guy, Mark was humileated. He knew somehow 
<br>
 Ty had changed every thing about his old life, he wasent the big guy who got respect because of his size anymore. 
<br>

<br>
 June had no choice but to leive Mark there and she went back home after she hugged Mark in front of all his old workers 
<br>
 and kissed his little forhead befor she left, Mark was now the brunt of all the jokes his old crew could come up with, they 
<br>
 made him do real menial jobs and had him running after shit for guys that were under him just friday they called him Marky 
<br>
 and little tike and shit like that. Poor Mark was now there worker and not the other way around. 
<br>

<br>
 June returned when the boss told her to and picked up Mark he was exhusted and dirty from doing all the shitty jobs no 
<br>
 else would do now that they had a little guy who couldnt tell them he wasent going to do what they wanted. And they proved 
<br>
 the point to him every time he objected to them, they made him clean the porta johns with just a rag and a bucket and then 
<br>
 gave him a swirly at the resturant where they took him for lunch, by the time June got there to get him he had long dirty 
<br>
 streaks down his still dimpled cheecks from the crying that he seemed to do almost uncontrolably now. Mark was sniffling 
<br>
 all the way home and cryed easyly at the thought of haveing been turned into such a little whimp. But he cryed more about 
<br>
 the fact that he might have to do this all again tomarrow.</p>
