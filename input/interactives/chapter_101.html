<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dustin was feeling awful how was he going toexplain his sudden change from budding stud to ultra dud, he was a populare 
<br>
 guy with lots of freands and even a girl freand just friday, and now he was way to thin to be on the football team or any 
<br>
 other sport for that matter. Ty left him walking by himself telling him that he didnt want to be seen with such a geek at 
<br>
 school, dustin was totaly humileated by the statement and just wanted to leive the school and go home to hide so no one 
<br>
 would see him like he looked now, but Ty had told him that he would leive him the way he was or worse if he left. 
<br>

<br>
 Ty told Dustin to go to his first class and not to leive it no matter what happened to him while he was there. Dustin 
<br>
 didnt know what he meant by no matter what happened and was expecting the worse, but he reluctantly went to his class as 
<br>
 ordered. Poor Dustin was the brunt of all the jokes in the class, and even his old freands treated him like a stranger, Ty 
<br>
 had taken away his popularity as well as his weight and his good looks. 
<br>

<br>
 Dustin also found it hard to concentrate on his class work as well he knew that he was usally pretty good with numbers 
<br>
 and he usally breezed this class but now he was haveing problems with the easyest of problems. he new that Ty had changed 
<br>
 him somehow because he was now the dumbest kid in the class and every one was picking up on it, his teacher asked him to 
<br>
 answer a math problem that he knew on friday and now he couldnt even concieve an answer for the simple question, then he 
<br>
 asked him an even easyer question just to see how dumb Dustin really was. &quot;Alright Dustin lets just get some prespective as 
<br>
 to just what you do know, How much is 10X10 Dustin that should be an easy one for you!&quot; His teacher said in an exasperated 
<br>
 tone, and patiently waited for the answer. 
<br>

<br>
 Dustin was totaly ashamed not only was he being treated like a dumbass he now didnt know what the answer was even if it 
<br>
 was easy to him before it was now way to complcated and he figeted in his seat, and stugled in his mind for the answer, &quot;I 
<br>
 dont know sir!!&quot; Dustin finally said. The whole class seemed to scream the answer at one time 100 stupidass, he herd one 
<br>
 guy say, &quot;Shouldnt you be in speacial ed sped boy?&quot; another piped back. Dustim was humileated again and tears started to 
<br>
 form in his eyes. 
<br>

<br>
 Dustin was made fun of for the rest of the hour and just couldnt wait to get out of the class he had like just last week, 
<br>
 the bell rang and Dustin practiclly ran out of the class, Ty was in the hall waiting on him when he came out.&quot;Hey beanpole 
<br>
 how was your math class dumbass?&quot; Ty said with a grin, &quot;You did this to me you made me dumb didnt you?&quot; Dustin said in 
<br>
 almost a whisper he didnt want anyone hear him say that he was now dumb to. &quot;NAW DUST YOU WERE ALWAYS DUMB!&quot; Ty said so 
<br>
 every one could hear him, Dustins face got red and he ran away from Ty, Ty soon caught up with him though and walked just 
<br>
 behind him as he went down the hall to his next class. &quot;You know Dust your just going to get dumber as the day goes by dont 
<br>
 ya? Hell by the time todays over ya wont even be able to spell your own name!&quot; Ty said as he pushed by him and went to his 
<br>
 own class. 
<br>

<br>
 Dustins heart sank why was Ty doing this to him he knew he had picked on him before but he couldnt have deserved this. 
<br>
 Dustin reluctantly went to his next class it was english, and again he thought he was doing pretty good in this class to, 
<br>
 but not today the same thing seemed to happen to him as he tryed to do thework the teacher wanted him to do easy stuff 
<br>
 before but not now. Dustin looked at the top of his paper where he had written his name, he fully expected to have spelled 
<br>
 it wronge he didnt though. But it did look like a child had scribbled it there, he couldnt turn this paper in it looked 
<br>
 like a fourth graders hand writing, not the 10th grader he was now. 
<br>

<br>
 Dustins next class was gym and he regretted that one more than anyother at his present size he would be the laughing 
<br>
 stock of the whole class, sure enough he was the brunt of the crulest jokes of the day. And the recieving end of all the 
<br>
 balls thrown that day. Dutin was knocked down during his shower and thanks to Ty was made fun of for haveing the smallest 
<br>
 cock and no real adult body hair, Ty had taken that away as Dustin walked down the hall towards the Gym, Dustin didnt find 
<br>
 out till he was being made fun of. 
<br>

<br>
 The rest of the day was just as hard on poor Dustin and much to his own shame Ty had fixed it so that by the end of the 
<br>
 day he could indeed no longer even spell his own name, Dustin was taken out of his fifth hour class and moved to the 
<br>
 retarted section of the school for speacial training for the mentally handycaped students. Ty had completed his plan to 
<br>
 totally destroy Dustin.</p>
