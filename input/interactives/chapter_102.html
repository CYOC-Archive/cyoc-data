<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The school day ended and Ty waited for dustin to come out of the special ed class he was taken to, one of Tys freands 
<br>
 had told him that his stupid brother was taken out of his fifth hour class because he couldnt even spell his own name. Ty 
<br>
 just laughed when he herd it and was waiting with a big grin on his face as poor Dustin came out of the room with his head 
<br>
 hung low. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Well how goes it Dusty ya look abit bumbed out for some reason dude. Or should I say dud!&quot; Ty said as Dustin looked 
<br>
 over at him.&quot;You come hear to see what ya did to me Ty!ISH THISH ENOUGH FOR YOU OR WHAT!!!&quot; Dustin said never really 
<br>
 looking up to say it, he had been taken out of his class and publicaly humileated in front of the whole class. &quot;Well what 
<br>
 now Ty do you turn me in ta a fagh now or what!&quot; Dustin said with a slight slur to his speach, it was another one of the 
<br>
 many changes that Ty gave him with out telling him, he now sounded as dumb as Ty had made him. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;No Dusty! But its a thought though!!&quot; Ty said laughing at the thought of it. &quot;NO Dustin its time to go home and wait to 
<br>
 see how your old mans day went, you know he didnt go right to work this mourning he tryed to go home! But I fixed it so he 
<br>
 would have to go!&quot; Ty said with a smile as he pushed his now tall skinny dumb as hell brother down the hall as they walked. 
<br>
 &quot;You like being pushed big brother? cause I know I hated it.&quot; Ty said as they got out of the building and headed for the 
<br>
 bus. 
<br>

<br>
 Dustin just stayed quiet he had been picked on all day and just wanted to go home and hide in his room, he figured that 
<br>
 his life was pretty much over now and he was about to cry just thinking about it. He fought off tears the whole way home, 
<br>
 he had been turned into a whimp and now a dumbass and didnt want to add being a baby to the new list of things people had 
<br>
 called him during the day. 
<br>

<br>
 The bus pulled in front of their house and Dustin got up first and started to leive the bus ahead of Ty, but Ty would 
<br>
 have none of that it was Dustins turn to follow him and he pushed Dustin down into an empty seat and walked ahead of his 
<br>
 now weaker brother.&quot;Your behind me now Dustin and dont forget it either!&quot; Ty yelled at dustin so every one could hear it. 
<br>
 Dustin could no longer fight back the tears and he just began to cry as they got off the bus. 
<br>

<br>
 Dustin was holding his hand to his face to hide it but everyone knew he was crying and he got laughed at one more time 
<br>
 before he even made the santuary of his own home, Ty again laughed at him as he walked into the house and dustin came in 
<br>
 sniffleing behind him, &quot;well guess what Dustin ya did as I asked you to so guess what happens next!&quot; Ty said as Dustin sat 
<br>
 down on the couch, &quot;What? ya gonna change me back?&quot; Dustin said in a quiet voice, &quot;Thats right Dusty Im changeing ya back!&quot; 
<br>
 Ty said with a smile, Dustin looked up and for the first time that day he smiled, then he felt his jeans begin to get 
<br>
 tight on him and his protruding teeth receded back to there almost perfect old way of looking his chin and jaw both became 
<br>
 strong and angulare, Dustin quickly stood up and undid his tighting belt and unbuttoned his jeans, the zipper was forced 
<br>
 down by his now growing muscles and then the jeans back ripped as his ass returned to its old athleticly shaped jock butt 
<br>
 that he had before. 
<br>

<br>
 Dustin ran for the mirror to see how he looked, he had to take off the thick glasses that Ty had forced him to wear they 
<br>
 were to blurry to his eyes now and Dustin was more than happy to take them off. Dustin whiped off his shirt and stood in 
<br>
 front off the mirror, he was back and he was even more good looking than he was before, instead of a four pack of abs he 
<br>
 now had a six pack and his bicepts were a good 18 inches now, his face was more mature looking as well he was sporting a 
<br>
 good thick mustash and a proment five oklock shadow to go with it and he had finally gotten the deep dimples that ran in 
<br>
 his fathers side of the family. He really did look quite the catch now. 
<br>

<br>
 Then he thought about it why would Ty make him look better than he did before there had to be a catch some where in all 
<br>
 of this. &quot;Whats the catch Ty why make me look better than before dude!&quot; Dustin said solomly, &quot;Well Im glad you asked me 
<br>
 that Dustin, there is just a few things diffrent about you but you'll find them out in time.&quot; Ty said with a smile Dustin 
<br>
 didnt like the thought of that at all. 
<br>

<br>
 Dustin went up to his room he knew he would have to get out of these tight underwear and into some thing that fit him 
<br>
 better, when he got there he looked over at his bed it still had a big stain where he had wet it the nite before, thanks to 
<br>
 Ty that was he thought, and began to flip the mattress over, but it seemed real heavy though like it was made of something 
<br>
 more dence than the mattress material, Dustin blew Ty off as his just not being all the way up to his old self yet, maybe 
<br>
 his new muscles just took more time to get there streanth back. So Dustin turned it over and began to take off his 
<br>
 rediculusly tight underwear, what he saw when he did though shocked him his dick was way to small it looked positivly 
<br>
 childlike, He knew there had to be a catch to all of this, but he was to afraid of being turned into a weakling again to 
<br>
 even ask Ty why he decided to take his budding manhood from him.</p>
