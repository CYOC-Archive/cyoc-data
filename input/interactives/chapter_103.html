<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dustin heard the truck pull in the driveway, Dustin quickly went to his dresser to get dressed into his old sized jeans he quickly threw on a pair of his underwaer and
<br>
 was happy that they fit him so well, he got dressed in a pair of his jeans that also now fit him perfectly they were even a bit tight on him every where exept his crotch
<br>
 area that is, there where his once proud member had streached the crotch area over time waqs a visable wrinkle and just a hint of what used to be there. 
<br>

<br>
 Dustin felt cheated by this but he was also just happy to be big again, maybe Ty would change that part of him back later if he did as he was asked to, Dustin ran to
<br>
 the big mirror his dad gave hime when he started weight training and did a muscle poss with out his shirt on sure enough he looked spectaculare, and smiled at himself.
<br>
 Dustin grabed a muscle tee and threw it on, his now bigger pecs filled it out nicely and he looked like the up and comeing stud he was trying to look like before Ty
<br>
 changed him, he loved the way he looked all exept the dick part that was. 
<br>

<br>
 Dustin threw on his old Nikes and bolted out of his room he couldnt wait to show off his new look to his mom and dad. Dustin was so wraped up in the way he looked
<br>
 that he forgot about how Ty had changed his mom and dad also, plus he had no clue as to the change Ty induced on Mark after he was at school. 
<br>

<br>
 Dustin went down stairs and went to the kitchen to see his dad and show off his new body. But what he saw shocked him his dad was now dawrf size and skinny as
<br>
 hell, and his mom was still a fat cow, &quot;Dad is that you? Dustin said, they both looked up and staired at Dustin, they had both been crying alot a their eyes were red and
<br>
 puffy from wipeing the tears out of their eyes. Marks face had greasy tear trails down his cheeks and hung his head down in shame, he didnt want his son to see him
<br>
 like this, but then it seemed to hit him, &quot;Dustin your back to normale what happened is Ty going to change us to!!&quot; Mark said and almost smiled, maybe it was all over
<br>
 finally! 
<br>

<br>
 Ty was in his room when they got their and didnt know what Mark actually looked like he had changed him over the phone so he really didnt know what Mark looked
<br>
 like, Ty could hear him ask Dustin about changeing them as well and started to laugh even before he got into the room, Mark heard him laughing and to him it didnt
<br>
 sound like a good thing, as a matter of fact it sounded evil and Marks heart sunk he knew Ty wasent done with him yet. 
<br>

<br>
 Ty entered the kitchen and smiled and then he laughed at the way Mark looked, &quot;God look at your liitle ass! Man drink some milk mark it does the body good dude! Ty
<br>
 was watching TV in his room and that milk commercial was just on and looking at how pathetic Mark looked now made the comment seem so right he couldnt help but
<br>
 say that. 
<br>

<br>
 Mark didnt laugh, he just glared up at Ty and staired angerly at him. Mark figured by the comment that Ty had no intensions of turning him back to the stud he was.
<br>
 The nitemare would probly continoue as it was going. June didnt seem to feel the same way as Mark did and quickly said hellow to Ty and smiled, it caused her chin to
<br>
 look like she had three chins though and Ty couldnt help but laugh. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Well Ty honey we did as you asked us to dear!&quot; June said innocently &quot;Are you going to keep your part of the deal and change us back too!&quot; June smiled again, she
<br>
 really didnt feel like smileing but she did a good job acting like she did, Ty knew she was just placating him but played the game all the same,&quot;Yes June you did do as I
<br>
 asked and so I will give you back your body!&quot; And with that said June felt her body growing back to its thin well toned body she too couldnt help but smile as she
<br>
 returned to her former self. Tht left only poor Mark nothing was happening to him at all, &quot;What about me Ty? are you going to change me back too!&quot; Mark asked as
<br>
 nicely as he could,&quot;NO MARK YOU GET TO STAY LIKE THAT!!&quot; Ty said starnly. &quot;WHY WHAT DID I DO? I DID AS YOU ASKED!!&quot; Mark said as tears
<br>
 rolled down his cheeks again. &quot;PLEASE TY DONT LEIVE THIS WAY!!&quot; Mark said as his hands went to his cover his face and he cryed so hard that his shoulders
<br>
 quaked. &quot;Stop crying Mark! You dont deserve to be a big guy anymore, you disobeyed my orders and thats why you still a whimp!&quot; Ty said as he came up behind the
<br>
 crying now whimpish Mark. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;IM SORRY! IM SO SORRY TY PLEASE!!!&quot; Mark said as he sniffled,&quot;PLEEAASSSE!!&quot; Mark growned, Ty felt sorry for him but he knew that Mark was still
<br>
 going to be a asshole if he turned him back to his old self, Mark as far as Ty new it had never felt how it felt to be a small geeky guy, and this was a fitting punishment
<br>
 for him, &quot;Alright Mark Ill make you bigger then, but not as big as you were!&quot; Ty began to concentrait and Mark began to grow he could fell his teeth grow back to the
<br>
 way they were and his eyesite returned to normale, he quickly took off the glasses and rubbed his face, Mark could feel himself getting taller but his muscles didnt
<br>
 seem to be getting that much bigger. 
<br>

<br>
 Ty stoped looking at him and Mark couldnt feel anymore changes going on, he knew that he didnt get tall enough or big enough to be his old self again and looked at Ty
<br>
 with a look of shock on his face,&quot;Your not stoping now are you Ty?&quot; Mark said as he looked down at his body, Ty had changed his clothes along with his body but he
<br>
 was still skinny as hell, and he was still a few inches shorter then June, June was only 5'4&quot; so he knew he was less than that. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;NO PLEASE TY DONT LEIVE ME THIS SMALL!!&quot; Mark screamed as Ty just smiled and left the room. Mark ran to the liveing room to see what he looked like
<br>
 in the mirror, &quot;NO!!!&quot; Mark screamed his old cute face was back but he was a short skinny weakling he steped on the scales that were still in the kitchen and began to
<br>
 cry again 95Lbs. &quot;NO NO NO NO NO!!!!!&quot; Mark screamed.</p>
