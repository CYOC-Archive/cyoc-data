<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark was so depressed at what Ty hadent done for him that he just went to the kitchen table and put his head down and cryed in his spread arms,June and Dustin just
<br>
 looked at him they couldnt do anything for him, only Ty could do that. June walked over to him and put her hands on his quivering thin shoulders and rubbed them, she
<br>
 could feel his bones easyly and it gave her the creaps, god he so skinny and small now. She thought he was nothing like the dashing muscle jock she had married, short
<br>
 guys or skinny guys were never what she looked for in guys no matter how nice there faces looked they were always a turn off to her. 
<br>

<br>
 And now her once big husband was one of those guys, June began to cry again herself she couldnt imagine being married to such a small skinny guy, let alone haveing
<br>
 sex with one. Ty had thought about that scenreo as well and concentrated on Marks mind he thought it would be fun to see how June treated him if he wanted to make
<br>
 love to her at his present size. First he would have to take away Marks memorys of being so big before or he might not be able to even get it up. 
<br>

<br>
 With in moments Mark stoped crying and raised his head out of his arms and wiped the tears out of his eyes, June didnt know what to think about it,Mark had a blank
<br>
 stair on his face as he got up from the table and started to go up the stairs June followed him out of the kitchen and just staired at him as he did so. June looked down
<br>
 at his jeans as he walked, Ty had changed his jeans to match his slightly bigger body, and she could see that Ty had changed his jeans back into levis again, she could
<br>
 read the lable on the back, they were a size 26-28 students size jeans, despite the fact that the waist fit his the rest of the jeans still looked loose and they just hung
<br>
 from his waist strait down on his thin frame. June just shook her head, here was this guy who used to be able to fill out jeans that were a size 33 or 34 in the waist and
<br>
 fill them out nicely for that matter, now stuck in kid size jeans that were to small even for her waist and even they were baggy on him. 
<br>

<br>
 Mark didnt say a thing as he went up stairs, Ty had fixed it so he was just going through the motions, Marks mind was just a blank for the time being, and he went to
<br>
 their room and got undressed and and went to take a shower. Ty concentrated on him as he showered and made him as horny as a guy could get. Marks memorys of
<br>
 being a big guy were put into the back of his mind somewhere, Ty wanted them to stay intacked so he could bring them back later and Mark would then remember and
<br>
 miss his old self again. What good would the lesson be if he didnt remember the past Ty thought, but that would come later. 
<br>

<br>
 June and Dustin went back to the table and talked about everything that Ty had done to the family in low tones and whispers they didnt want Ty to hear them. &quot;Tys
<br>
 doing something to your dad I know he is! why else would he just go up stairs like that!&quot; June whispered to Dustin as they sat there. Ty ignored them and went back to
<br>
 his room, he was still trying to figure out what to do to Dustin he had no intentions about leiving him the way he was now. 
<br>

<br>
 Tys power had gone to his head he was begining to become a meglamaniac. Ty of coarse didnt pick up on his own mental changes, he just wanted revenge in the most
<br>
 serious way. Ty thought about the perfect senrio for Dustin, he had been driveing for several months now that he was almost seventeen and all, so June and Mark had
<br>
 let him drive the old sedan around when he and Cindy Dustins steady girl freand went out together on dates from time to time. 
<br>

<br>
 Ty concentrated on the pair as they talked at the table and he learned that he not only could change both their minds as well as their bodys, but now he could hear their
<br>
 very thought as well. Both had deep seated fears built up from their experiences induced by Tys changes in them, but both still had strong resilence towards the events
<br>
 and both seemed to be dealing with them very well indeed. 
<br>

<br>
 This sort of surprized Ty, he really thought they lacked the fortitude to get over it so easyly, but they did, oh well so much the better he thought as he was also quite
<br>
 incontrol of their mind as well. Ty concentrated on both of them and pushed the memorys of the last four days to the farthest reaches of their minds, he snuck down
<br>
 stairs and listened to them talking to each other, the conversation changed along with their memorys and soon they were just laughing and talking about small trivial
<br>
 things, like how Dustin was doing at school and about Dustins girl freand. 
<br>

<br>
 Ty capitalized on that subject and soon it was all that the two were talking about, before long Dustin was on the phone talking to Cindy and asking her if she wanted to
<br>
 go to the mall with him to buy clothes that werent so tight for Dustin, in Dustins mind and his mothers he'd just had another growth spurt and he had out grown his old
<br>
 clothes again. June hadnt completely forgot about Mark though but Ty had fixed her mind to see him as he was now and not to remember him as a stud anymore, &quot;I
<br>
 wish your father could have a growth spurt! He's just so skinny! I guess you got my genes instead of his scrawny ones! Lucky for you I'd say honey!&quot; June said in an
<br>
 asasperated tone as Dustin hung the phone up. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Ah yea I guess so mom, well anyway can I get some money mom? Me and Cind are going to go to the mall and get me some clothes that fit me is that alright mom?&quot;
<br>
 Dustin asked as he reached in the fridge and grabed a couple of slices of lunch meat and just started to eat it as is without bothering to make a sandwitch out of it, Ty
<br>
 had wandered in and just watched the whole thing go down. Ty couldnt beleive this he had turned them back to their old selves and now they were both back to their
<br>
 old ways as well. 
<br>

<br>
 Dustin was back to his old lazy self, he was to lazy to even make himself a sandwitch, and June was back to thinking only about herself again, she didnt even reconize
<br>
 the fact that Ty had come into the room. June was caught off gaurd by Dustins request and just shook her head, &quot;I guess honey, here take this but bring me a reciept
<br>
 though!&quot; June said as she got out two hundred dollar bills and gave it to Dustin without so much of a thought. Ty was pissed, they completely forgot about his birthday
<br>
 but it was no problem at all for them to shell out big bucks for their presiuos son Dustin for lousy clothes, it in fureated Ty, but he kept it to himself. 
<br>

<br>
 Their time was comeing, and soon they would regrett this. Ty concentrated on Dustin, this time you'll suffer public humililation you dumb fuck he thought as he shrank
<br>
 Dustins bladder to that of his old 8 year old size, Dustin was now guzzleing a coke and grabed the two hunder dollars out of his moms hand,&quot;Thanks mom! See ya
<br>
 later!&quot; Dustin said as he grabed the keys and started to leive, June finaly noticed Ty and stoped Dustin from leiving, &quot;Hey wait a minute Dustin! Take Ty with you hon,
<br>
 Im sorry Ty but I forgot your birthday saturday and I wanted to make it up to you! here take this and get what you want hon its not much but its yours to spend on
<br>
 what you want!&quot; June said as she pulled a lousy twenty dollar bill out and gave it to Ty. 
<br>

<br>
 Ty grabbed the bill and thanked her all the while thinking about how cheep it was, here it was she forgets his birthday, and all he gets is a lousy twenty dollars, and
<br>
 Dustin gets two hundred just for cloths now how is that fair. Ty would enjoy watching Dustin though and his changes were just beginning. 
<br>

<br>
 Dustin protested at the fact that he had to take Ty with him and Cindy, but his mom stoped him telling him this is a monday nite and not the weekend so it wasent as if
<br>
 he was going on a date with Cindy, so Dustin complied and told Ty to hurry up and get ready he didnt have time to wait on him. 
<br>

<br>
 Ty smiled and thought you'll get yours asshole just wait and see.</p>
