<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Carl looked down at his shorts and his piss and shit laidened underwear that now were draped over his waist band of the shorts that just minutes before fit his waist
<br>
 tightly, and then he looked over at Ty who was approching him as he stood there unable to move. &quot;You were saying something about Depends undergarments when
<br>
 you came in here werent you Carl?&quot; Ty said with a smile that belonged on the devils own face as he said it. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Well it looks like things have slightly changed for you now doesent it Carl, your not quite the big guy with all the manly tatoos ya used ta be are ya!&quot; Ty said as he
<br>
 reached out and grabed Carls twig thin wrist and twisted it, Ty grit his teeth as he twisted it till he heard poor Carls shoulder make a slight snapping noise, Ty knew that
<br>
 he didnt break it but it would hurt for quite some time to come, Carl growned in a now much higher almost girlish tone as he did it. 
<br>

<br>
 Dustin just watched with his mouth shut tight, he was breathing deeply out of his nostrils as he watched in horror as his nemisis was turned from a menacingly huge
<br>
 guy to a geeky looking skinny as hell guy with fag tatoos now replaceing the ones that Carl thought made him look more menacing and manly. 
<br>

<br>
 Ty didnt seem to care what either guy thought about, the power was his and the world, and espesialy this mall was his oyster for now and he was going to do more
<br>
 than spend a lousy twenty dollars here. &quot;Im going to leive you two here for now Dustin so if you know whats good for you! YOU WONT LET HIM OR YOU LEIVE
<br>
 THIS ROOM!! GOT THAT!!&quot; Ty said with a look that would have scared the devil himself. 
<br>

<br>
 Dustin didnt say a word he just knodded yes and Ty left. Dustin went over to the now pathetically skinny Carl and helped him to his feet, he was still in a state of shock
<br>
 and denile over what had just happened to him and he had a far away look on his face and was mumbling incoherently about how he was going to kill Ty for this his
<br>
 skinny head rocked on his now thin neck as he said it he was defenetly in a state of pure denile over the incedent. 
<br>

<br>
 Dustin got him to step out of his now soiled and to large sized clothes, carls sleeveless shirt hung down from his tiny shoulders and just barly covered his privates when
<br>
 he stood up, &quot;WHERE AM I?&quot; Carl said almost unledgebly, &quot;WHO ARE YOU?&quot; He said as Dustin got him to sit down on one of the stalls toilets, &quot;Its me Carl Dustin!
<br>
 Dont worry Ill take care of you, so just relaxe alright old buddy.&quot; Dustin said in a calm but quiet tone. 
<br>

<br>
 Ty walked out from the long hall that led to the bathrooms and smiled, he was now the king of all that surrounded him and no one could stop him. Ty walked back to
<br>
 where Cindy was still sitting and smiled again, &quot;We gotta buy some pant for old pisser boy girl!&quot; Ty said as she looked up to him. &quot;Dont call him that you asshole! Im
<br>
 sure he feels bad enough without your fucked up additude towards it!&quot; Cindy said in a tone that amazed Ty! She cared about the asshole WOW! Ty smiled down and
<br>
 offered her a hand up, he was feeling like a king now and felt he could be gracious. 
<br>

<br>
 She accepted his helping hand and the two walk over towards the Gap to buy Dustin some clean jeans and some clean underwear to go with them, &quot;You know Ty I
<br>
 feel awful about what happened to Dustin! But I feel worse because I think it sort of funny to watch a big old jock like him wet his pants in front of everyone! You
<br>
 know what I mean? Dont hate me for saying that either Ty!&quot; Cindy said as she put her hand on Tys shoulder and rubbed it as they walked. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;I dont hate you Cindy! But you do seem to hate me sometimes?&quot; Ty said as the deep hate he felt for her faded to an almost old freands feeling. &quot;I dont hate you Ty! I
<br>
 think your cute! And Ive goot the perfect girl in mind for you as well!&quot; Cindy said as she let go of his shoulder and both went into the store side by side smileing. 
<br>

<br>
 Ty was thinking about how much he liked Cindy now that he got to see this side of her. He was begging to get jelious over the fact that this pretty girl liked his asshole
<br>
 brother more than she liked him. &quot;Hey Cindy?&quot; &quot;What Ty?&quot; &quot;Why do you like Dustin so much anyway?&quot; Ty asked. &quot;I dont know Ty? I just do I guess?&quot; Cindy said as
<br>
 she began to pull jeans that were around Dustins size off the rack and inspect them for how they looked. &quot;Here what do you think? There his size I think?&quot; She said as
<br>
 she held them against Tys waist, Ty was emberised by this yea sure they were Dustins size but against his still shorter frame they draged the ground in folds as she
<br>
 held them against him as he tryed to get away from her doing it. &quot;Look dont do that please Cindy its emberissing alright! There not for me there for Dustin so dont use
<br>
 me as a model alright! WERE NOT THE SAME SIZE ALRIGHT!!&quot; Ty said rather streanly, poor Cindy turned red with emberisment and pull the jeans up from his
<br>
 shorter waist, &quot;OPPS sorry Ty!&quot; Cindy said and giggled. Ty thought about what she was doing and how they seemed to be getting along pretty good and all and smiled.
<br>

<br>

<br>
 &quot;Alright Cindy what is it that you like about Dustin then! I mean is it the way he looks or god forbid the way he acts or what?&quot; &quot;AHH! I guess a little of all those
<br>
 things! I mean he's cute in the face I love his dimples and all, and I know that his bodys a turn on to me? But! Yea I like the way he treats me Ty he's so sweet and
<br>
 all!&quot; Cindy said as she went over and grabed a pair of bikni breifs for Dustin to wear,&quot;There now lets go pay for these and you can bring them to him so we can either
<br>
 finish shopping or leive? I think hes done shopping for today dont you?&quot; Cindy said in that somewhat airhead californian accent of hers. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Yea I think thats a safe assumption Cindy.&quot; Ty said with a smile despite Cindys lack of real brains she did tend to make him smile so he just shook his head and went
<br>
 to pay for the clothes, Ty looked at the size of the levies she pick out for Dustin and smiled, they werent going to fit him, they were way to small in the waist for the
<br>
 new and improved Dustin to wear and they werent even his size before he was inproved by Ty, they were a size 28-32, Ty knew that even before he wore 30-32s and
<br>
 now he could easyly fit into 32-32s he was now that much bigger, hell the ones he had on were 31-32s and they were the biggest waist size dustin had and they were
<br>
 to tight on him now. 
<br>

<br>
 Ty was going to say something to her but held back, he figured it wasent worth it he just make Dustin smaller to fit the jeans and see what Cindy thought of him then.
<br>
 They payed and both left the store laughing and cutting up amonst each other, why spoil a good time when theres no reason to Ty thought. 
<br>

<br>
 As they left the store and headed back to the bathroom area of the Mall something or I should say some guy caught Tys eye. The guy was yelling at this very nice
<br>
 looking girl who seemed to be just trying to end the fight and get on with their shopping, but the guy wasent just loud he was annoyingly so, it seemed as if he wanted
<br>
 the Malls paitents to hear his greivence with this poor girl, &quot;God I hate that when a guy bitches his girl freand or wife out like that in puplic!&quot; Cindy said in a low tone to
<br>
 Ty, Tyshook his head in agreement and smiled, well he wouldnt do it if he was the little defenclss one and not the other way around! The thought came out as words as
<br>
 he said it and Cindy heard part of it. &quot;What did you say TY?&quot; Ty just shrugged his shoulders &quot;YHH? NOTHING CINDY!&quot; &quot;I Heard ya Ty you said he wouldnt do that
<br>
 if he was the smaller of the two! and your right! but she puts up with that shit!I know I wouldnt!&quot; Cindy said as they passed them, he was still screaming at her about
<br>
 something and before Ty could even think about it he was turning the tables on the guy as he yelled at the poor helpless girl. with in the seconds it took Cindy and Ty to
<br>
 pass the couple the guy was begging to loose both height and weight, his work clothes that had fit his boby quite well, well enough for Cindy to comment about his
<br>
 physique and Ty couldnt help but notice his well toned body as well. 
<br>

<br>
 Before they even passed the guy his work pants began to get looser looking on him and his work shirt that huged his massive bicepts like a second skin began to not
<br>
 only get looser on his arms but also the buttoned sleeves began to ride over his once bigger hands, he seemed to notice what was happening to him and so did his girl
<br>
 freand or wife for that matter, Tys powers were now out of control as he was now able to only think of something and it would happen uncontrolably and a hell of
<br>
 alote faster than he was expecting it to. 
<br>

<br>
 The guys pants that fit him so well that you could make out his quads were now getting so loose on his waist that even his belt didnt hold them up, he was fully aware
<br>
 of it though and was freaking out, you could hear both of them saying shit about what was happening to the guy!Ty turned around and stoped walking he didnt want a
<br>
 scean like this to occure it was to dangerous but this time even he couldnt stop it, it just contioued to go as his original thoughts had purpossed it to. 
<br>

<br>
 The guys muscle mass was dissapearing fast as he swung around and tryed to steady himself against the fountain wall they were standing by he thought he was just
<br>
 dizzy or something and as he grabed the now taller wall his kakie brown work pants weighted by his belt and heavy chained wallet brought them down around his
<br>
 knees. &quot;OH GOD! OH GOD WHATS HAPPENING!! He yelled loud enough for half the Malls crowd to turn around and take notice. This is real bad Ty thought as
<br>
 the unsuspecting victom fell backwards into the pool as he triped on his now over sized pants, his companion was visably shaken as well but for her at leist the
<br>
 argument was over. 
<br>

<br>
 Ty couldnt beleive Cindy though she just trudged on toward the bathrooms and ignored the whole thing as it went down, it totally surprized him, was she just so
<br>
 intrested in Dustin that nothing else mattered to her or what? Tythought as a crowd to big for him to see what was happening with the guy formed aroud the fountain.
<br>
 Ty freaked for a moment as the crowd gathered around the now thin man in the pool. &quot;Oh god!&quot; Ty said out loud it was way to late to do anything about now though
<br>
 and he turned around and just followed Cindy as she quickened her pace and almost raced towards the bathrooms, &quot;here Ty take these to Dustin hes been in there
<br>
 waiting along time so hurry up Ty!&quot; Cindy said in an excited tone Ty was again dumb founded by this here was this perfect girl all concered over how his asshole
<br>
 brother felt why? 
<br>

<br>
 Ty grabed the bag of Gap clothes out of her hands and went to the bathroom with them, Ty smiled as he thought about the fact that the jeans were not the right size
<br>
 and were way to small for Dustins now bigger waist, &quot;Hey Dustin where are you man I got the change of clothes your girl freand picked out for you, do you want
<br>
 them or what?&quot; Ty said knowing that the fact that his girl freand was still just that his girl freand, would defenetly bring him out of his hideing place. It did and Ty
<br>
 laughed again at how he looked in his piss soaked jeans. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Here dumb ass she pick them out so dont complain to me if you dont like them!&quot; Ty said knowing that they were way to small for his present size, Dustin grabed the
<br>
 bag and looked at Ty, &quot;What are you going to do with Carl man!&quot; Dustin asked as he started to get out of his piss soaked jeans, &quot;We'er gonna leive him here! why do
<br>
 even care? the guys a jerk and you know it!&quot; Ty said as Dustin rolled his eyes in disbeleife and closed the stall door to get dressed in his new jeans. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;AHH FUCKK!!&quot; Dustin said as he looked at the size of his new jeans, &quot;These arnt gonna fit Ty you'll have to take them back dude I cant wear these! There way to
<br>
 small man!&quot; Dustin said as he slid the bag back under the stalls opening for Ty to take them back. &quot;The jeans will fit you trust me!&quot; Ty said as he pushed them back
<br>
 through the bottom opening. Dustin looked down at them and sighed, &quot;NO THERE TO SMALL TY!&quot; Dustin said as he tryed to push the bag back under the doors
<br>
 opening, Ty stoped it with his foot as he tryed and told him to try them on first or else!</p>
