<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dustin looked down at the bag that Ty had pushed back into the stall and thought about the or else statement that Ty had just made, Dustins was freaking out at first,
<br>
 what does Ty have in store for him? Is he going to try them on and have them fit him? If they did he would have to be reduced in order for them to fit, and he didnt
<br>
 want to be that small. Or was Ty going to make the clothes fit his body as it was now? Surely that had to be the case after all Ty had given him his new strong good
<br>
 looking body he had now! Why would he take it away from him now? 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;alright Ty Ill try them on! but you know your gonna have to make them fit me now. Im way to big for this size.&quot; Dustin said in a nice jokeing tone, he hoped that Ty
<br>
 would see he was complieing and just make the clothes bigger and not the other way around. 
<br>

<br>
 Ty smiled he had no intentions of leiving poor Dustin that big in the first place and Dustins own girl freand had sealed his fate for him. &quot;Well then put them on Dustin
<br>
 and lets get out of here!&quot; Ty said almost laughing. Dustin heard him giggle and his stomache turned, he hung his head and his eyes filled with tears as he began to put
<br>
 the small jeans on. As soon as he started to pull the tight little jeans up his legs he felt himself getting smaller, and he knew the ultamit outcome, he was the one who
<br>
 would be changed and not the jeans, he should have known by the simple fact that the underwear that she bought him were still to tight on him when he went to put the
<br>
 jeans on. 
<br>

<br>
 Dustin watched in shock as first his well muscled calfs thinned and then his thick musculare thighs and muscled butt shrank to fit into the size 28-32s Cindy had bought
<br>
 him. He wanted to cry as he managed to get the jeans around his waist and was easyly able to fasten the button and zip them up. He was now an easy 50Lbs lighter
<br>
 than he was and it was plainly visable as he looked down at his jeans and his bare chest, his powerful pecs were nearly gone and even at there reduced size they
<br>
 looked flabby and underdeveloped, his six pack abs were now a small flabby roll of baby fat at best, His powerful 18inch bicepts were now only nine inches at best and
<br>
 he was again a whimp in his prespective. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;WHY TY? WHY'D YA CHANGE ME AND NOT THE CLOTHES!!!&quot; Dustin said as he brought his hands to his face and began to cry. &quot;Because Dustin thats
<br>
 what I decided to do! NOW COME OUT AND LET ME SEE HOW YOU LOOK!!&quot; Ty yelled, Mark opened the door and what Ty saw made him giggle, Poor
<br>
 Dustin who was just recently the biggest stud in the school in his grade was now just one of the skinny guys, his mighty V shaped torso was gone and his pecs were
<br>
 both adulecent small and flabby, his stomach was just a roll of babys fat waiting for the inevitable changes that should have already occured to it, Ty loved that touch it
<br>
 made the still almost seventeen year old Dustin look like a lazy late blommer at best. 
<br>

<br>
 Dustin on the other hand was very dissapointed, gone again were all the years of weight training he had went through along with own normale inevitable growth
<br>
 changes that he would have went through at his present age, weight lifting or no weight lifting he knew he would look better then this in real life. But alas this as weird
<br>
 as it seemed was real life, he was now a tall thin guy, who for only reasons that Ty knew of now looked like his body hadent quite developed to its nornmal size and
<br>
 definisions. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Why Ty? Why this?&quot; Dustin said as he wondered over to a mirror to see if he was even the same age as he was, &quot;Just because! and thats that Dustin!&quot; Ty said as he
<br>
 started to walk towards the door of the bathroom that led into the Malls corridores, &quot;Come on Dustin were leiving!&quot; Ty demanded Dustin asked him to turn him back
<br>
 into the stud he was he even begged again, he didnt want to go out looking like this he tiold him to no avail. Ty got tierd of hearing him plead and whine and told him to
<br>
 finish getting dressed, but Dustin didnt stop pleading. Ty got mad and before Dustin finished his last plead he felt himself begin to get shorter, Ty took 7 inches from his
<br>
 height and another 35Lbs and stoped there. 
<br>

<br>
 Dustin was both shocked and pissed at the same time, now he not only was he shorter than Ty he was skinny as hell to boot, even the size 28 jeans wouldnt stay up
<br>
 around his waist anymore, &quot;GOD NOT THIS PLEASE!!&quot; Dustin gasped but it was to late. Ty had already turned around and ordered him to come with him or it
<br>
 would be much worse than it was now! Dustin wasent in any position to argue or for that matter plead for his size back and complied with his orders. 
<br>

<br>
 Ty turned around as he waited and before Dustin got up off the floor after putting his socks and boots back on Ty had made him just big enough again to fit into his
<br>
 knew jeans again, Dustin looked down at his legs as he sat there his jeans fit his waist but were still loose and were probly a size or two to big on him and the excess
<br>
 leanth of the fabiric pooled around his thin skinny calf area above his boots, he was still shorter than he used to be, and he was so depressed that he didnt even care if
<br>
 Ty just killed him anymore. 
<br>

<br>
 Ty left him sitting there, Dustin eventually got to his feet and looked at himself in the mirror again, he fought off tears as he just staired at his reflection, he was so
<br>
 skinny and short now, he looked like his dad looked when he first saw him for the first time since Ty changed his dad into an even more patheticlly skinny guy while
<br>
 they were at school that day. (SEE: The Perfect DAD for Dustin!! and Marks new job title, For descriptions.). 
<br>

<br>
 Dustin reluctantly left the malls bathroom and saw Ty was waiting for him, &quot;Lets go Dustin!&quot; &quot;Where Ty? I dont want to be seen like this!&quot; Ty just turned around and
<br>
 staired at him, Dustin felt a chill run through his pathetically skinny body and just followed him, he just kept his head hung low as they walked through the mall hopeing
<br>
 no one would reconize him. 
<br>

<br>
 Dustin got his wish it seemed, because even his girl freand seemed to either just ignore him or was just oblivious to his being there because she didnt even look at him
<br>
 as Ty and him passed her, she was talking to Carls girl freand, he could hear there conversation as he passed her, she was asking if Cindy if she had seen him and he
<br>
 clearly heard her say she hadent, he slowed down to hear more of the conversation between the two girls, he wanted to see if she mentioned him at all, she didnt. 
<br>

<br>
 Apearently Ty had fixed that for him too, now not only was he a whimp again he didnt have a girl freand either. And what was Ty going to do with the now faggish
<br>
 looking diminished Carl anyway, Dustin was both in a state of confusion denile and shock. He had way to many diffrent thoughts to deal with them all at once and he
<br>
 had the worst ansiety headache of his young life. 
<br>

<br>
 They entered the wide open covered pravillian area of the mall, and Dustin could hear what sounded like a model show or something going on, Ty turned around and
<br>
 looked down at Dustin, and gigled, &quot;Stop we'er watching this show dude, its a modeling show for guys clothes dude! look at these guys man there perfect!&quot; Ty said as
<br>
 he glanced back towards the male models as they gathered at the base of the ramp to accend it and walk the modeling catwalk. &quot;Now this will be FUN!!&quot; Ty said
<br>
 almost demonectly. 
<br>

<br>
 Dustin had a vague idea of what Ty was thinking and an even more clear idea of what he was capable of. Ty just turned around and ignored Dustin and staired at two
<br>
 guys that were standing close to the ramp, one was clearly a model, and the other was some kind of a hired hand or something, but he was a nice enough looking guy. 
<br>

<br>
 He was probly in his mid to late twentys, with dark brown hair of about meadium leanth, and sort of short and stocky looking, he was obviously not a model though, for
<br>
 one thing he had a small but promenent gut that showed above the waist of his still nice looking jeaned legs, at one time in the guys life probly before he got married to
<br>
 some cute girl he was in shape but he had that home cooking gut some guys seem to develope after they get to comfortable in their married lifes and just let themselfs
<br>
 go. 
<br>

<br>
 Dustins eyes filled with remorse over what Ty had done to his dad! At leist his dad still looked great and took care enough to exorsize and kept up his weight lifting
<br>
 routine even though he was completley satisfied with his married life, he war rock hard and well muscled until Ty changed him into a whimp like he was now. 
<br>

<br>
 Dustin didnt know what Ty had in mind, but he knew it had something to do with these two guys he was stairing at, Dustin had no choice but to just sit and watch what
<br>
 Ty would do next. Ty smiled and looked at the model, he was in great shape, probably 19 or 20 at best and very athletic looking, much like the way Dustin would have
<br>
 looked if it werent for Tys asshole revenge on him. The model wasent only in good shape though he was a very handsome looking dude as well, his face was the
<br>
 splitting image of Bradd Pits and his well muscled but not huge body was like an international males models body would be. 
<br>

<br>
 He had on a pair of swim trunks that looked like boxer breifs, and his perfect six pack abbs looked both tight and good on him like he did a thousand sit ups a day with
<br>
 not even a hint of a gut like the stage helper had, both were nice and cute looking but the model had the prefect bod compared to the other guy, Ty turned and looked
<br>
 down onto Dustins eyes, &quot;Watch this your going to love it!&quot; Ty said as he turned around and staired at the two guys real hard. 
<br>

<br>
 In a matter of moments the models six pack stomache started to get slighty looser looking and a very small but noticable roll of fat started to grow above the tight waist
<br>
 line of the swimming trunks, &quot;Watch that models absorbing that other guys weight!&quot; Ty laughed as he said that. &quot;Just keep an eye on them man!!&quot; Ty said in a happy
<br>
 tone. Sure enough the transfer seem to continue. The models perfect six pack abbs slowly lost there tight well toned defenition and a small but prominent gut replaced
<br>
 them, Dustin felt real bad for the guy, after all he knew the real work it took to get into that shape was strenuious at the leist and the diet that went with it was no
<br>
 picnic either` 
<br>

<br>
 But it was out of his control now and laid in the hands of a guy who didnt care about any of that, he was in this for the kicks and that was all. The models body
<br>
 continued its gaining of the unsuspecting stage helpers weight, both were kept unaware of the changes by Tys ever increasing minds power to change things. The
<br>
 stage hands body lost his gut as the poor model gained it and more of the mans weight, the stage hand was short and had a slight gut but nothing that a few weeks in a
<br>
 gym wouldnt have turned into a great body, but now as the small but prominent gut switched bodys they both looked like they were headed for the change of their
<br>
 lives. 
<br>

<br>
 The stage hands tight fitting jeans were rapidly becoming looser as he stood there in awe over the poor models rapid advancment into the world of the unfit, his firm
<br>
 stomach was now a fat gut that hung over his now way to tight swim suit and even he once muscled firm legs were both looseing the muscled firmness they had but
<br>
 also loosing size as well his muscled arms and pecs faded as they were replaced with the stage hands weight into fatty appendeges that looked now to fat and useless
<br>
 to be that of the storng musculare models selling points that they were. 
<br>

<br>
 before long both looked radically different with the stage hand now haveing to hold up his once tight fitting jeans and the model, his eyes as wide as quarters desperatly
<br>
 trying to push his stomach back into place with his hands. The poor stage hand who probly weighed at leist 165 and was only slightly out of shape now weighed less
<br>
 than a hundered if that, while the model who packed 175Lbs of well worked and dilegently toned muscle, now weighed at leist 250Lbs on a now fatty out of shape
<br>
 body, gone were his days as super model and gone were the stage hands days as the guy who could lift the required 75Lbs his job called for! 
<br>

<br>
 Ty smiled and told dusti it was time to go home now and left the poor guys standing there, neither knew what had happened or why but both were now changed for
<br>
 life!</p>
