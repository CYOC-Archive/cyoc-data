<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Marks mind was still a blank as he showered, Ty had fixed it so Mark wouldnt really gain any thoughts of what he looked like or who he was till he was drying off, this
<br>
 would give Ty and Dustin the time it would take for them to be out of the house and almost to the Mall by the time he got out of the shower. 
<br>

<br>
 Mark finished his shower almost an hour after he got in the shower, the water had gone from hot to warm and then tepid to cold by the time he used up all the 40
<br>
 gallons of water in the water heater, and now it was to cold even for his blank mind to tolerate. Mark was shivering by the time he got out and his uncontrolable
<br>
 erection that he had had the whole time was now gone, his dick that Ty had shrunk to only four and a half inches erect was now a poultry two and a quarter inches in
<br>
 its cold water flacid state. 
<br>

<br>
 even on his now much thinner and smaller body it looked tiny and positivly useless, but as he dried off the memorys started to flood his mind, memorys of him as a big
<br>
 guy, of 195Lbs and a much taller guy than the one stairing back at him in the bathrooms mirror, one of guy at leist a 6'1&quot; inchs tall. But the guy he saw in the mirror
<br>
 didnt even come close to that memory. 
<br>

<br>
 Marks clouded memory started to come back to him in ever more vivid visions, Tys powers of mind control werent as powerful as Ty had thought they would be and
<br>
 Mark was begining to remember alot more than Ty had expected he would, maybe it was the distance involved in the control element or maybee he was loosing the
<br>
 power or at leist it was limited at best. But none the less Mark was gaining control over his old thought just the same. 
<br>

<br>
 Marks emotions and actions on the other hand were still very much under the control of Tys last wish, and poor mark was still as horney as a guy could be, Mark
<br>
 staired at the mirrors reflection and a chill went down his spine. Was he really the big guy his memorys seemed to indicate or was he really just the skinny short guy
<br>
 looking back at him from the mirror. If anything was true it was that Tys powers had made a gulash of his memorys. 
<br>

<br>
 Marks cock hardend as he got dryed off and his primale urges took over were his mind seemed to fail, he knew he was married and that his wife was both buetiful and
<br>
 realetivly young, and that he had a very handsome strong son with this lady, but most of all that he was horney as hell. Mark couldnt control his erection it hardend to
<br>
 its now pitiful four and a half erect inches and ached for the sex it craved. 
<br>

<br>
 Mark went down stairs after dressing in the to his mind pitifully small jeans that seemed much to his dismay way to baggy on him, but his mind was still mince soup and
<br>
 they were in the bathroom with him so they must have been his, he didnt care though the erection in them the one that was to taughnt to stick down the leg of his jeans,
<br>
 the one he pulled to full attention in an upright position in the front of the small jeans now ruled the outcome of the next few moments to his now weird and
<br>
 ununderstandable life. SEX is what it screamed and sex was what he was going to have. 
<br>

<br>
 June was sitting in the liveing room looking through a cataloge and paying no attention to anything else and didnt even see him as he walked through the door, Mark
<br>
 was thinking of only one thing and one thing only...SEX. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;June! Hey honey where are the boys?&quot; Mark asked out loud, the sound of his voice seemed wrong it wasent as strong or deep as he expected it to be. He froze in his
<br>
 tracts over what he sounded like, it was almost child like and it left him with a look of dismay on his face. June looked up, she was still very much under the controled
<br>
 thoughts of Ty and just sighed and said &quot;Their at the Mall. Dustins had another growth spurt and hes and Ty are getting him some new clothes.&quot; June looked at how
<br>
 pitifully skinny her husband was and a chill ran down her spine, &quot;Why do you want to know where the boys are Mark?&quot; June asked in a exasperated tone. 
<br>

<br>
 Mark was at first afraid to tell her why, he didnt like the sound of his own voice and figured that this buetiful lady sitting there didnt seem to like it either, but hey he
<br>
 thought they were married and did have a kid together, and somewhere in the farthest reaches of his mixed up mind he seemed to remember haveing a very good sex
<br>
 life with this woman. Marks urges got the best of the situation and he finally asked for them to take advantage of the fact that they were alone. 
<br>

<br>
 Junes mind although completely under Tys control could remember that she didnt like skinny guys, she couldnt for the life of her remember or even picture makeing
<br>
 love to such a whimpy looking guy as Mark seemed to her now. She thought or at leist her minds own repulshion to the idea led her outer thoughts to think that the last
<br>
 real time she must have had sex with the scrawny guy asking for it now was at Dustins conception. For some reason she couldnt quite fathom at that moment, she had
<br>
 only made love to a guy who was twice the size of Mark now, she shivered visabley at the thought of it, but deep in her mind she knew that somehow this guy
<br>
 supported her and she knew she would have to complie to his demands. 
<br>

<br>
 June faked a smile and both went up stairs, the sex was one sided at best, with only Mark enjoying it, after all June couldnt even feel him in her enough to be stimulated
<br>
 by him, Mark seemed to remember it differently as well, he knew deep in his mind that he was good in bed and that June and him both loved sex, but he couldnt even
<br>
 feel her as deeply as he was used to in fact he couldnt even reach the bootom and feel the back wall of her virgina anymore, he knew this was wrong! No wonder she
<br>
 seemed uninterested, and even barley wet at best. Mark finally came as she faked her own orgasium, and they both laid in the bed silent, Marks eyes filled with tears
<br>
 as his mind now no longer under the thoughts of sex only cleared and the relization of the moment entered it. 
<br>

<br>
 Mark suddenly knew everthing that had happened to him, he knew why the love makeing felt wrong, he knew it was because he was now a skinny whimp with a
<br>
 pathetic little dick and not the big musculare well indowed man he was! 
<br>
 Junes own mind was clearing as well and she to came to the same realizations as Mark did and both wept as the thoughts and memorys of what had happened
<br>
 returned to them.</p>
