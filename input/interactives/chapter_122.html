<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Coach lumbered into the kitchen with his belt still undone. He lifted the front of his shirt and puffed out his belly as big as possible waddling toward his wife Mona. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;We're home Honey,&quot; he grunted, shoving his belly against her and loudly spanking the side of it, &quot;what's for dinner?&quot; Mona pulled away from her husband, and 
<br>
 looked down with disgust at his huge protruding stomach. She said nothing. Coach grinned broadly, and continued to flirt. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Would you believe I've already outgrown another pair of pants,&quot; he chuckled, kissing her cheek, &quot;I'm gonna go change into something bigger.&quot; With that, he turned 
<br>
 and rumbled out of the room, making the floor shake as much as possible. In the bedroom, he stripped off all his clothes, and pulled an enormous jockstrap out of 
<br>
 the top dresser drawer. The huge jock, which had been a gag gift from the varsity team, had always been much too large for him to actually wear. Now, he pulled 
<br>
 it on gleefully, and headed for the bathroom scale. The big man could not contain his enjoyment watching the numbers soar to an impressive three hundred and 
<br>
 sixty pounds. He stroked his belly, and admired his prodigious profile in the mirror. His reverie was interrupted by a sharp pounding at the door. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;I know what you're up to Tom Fowler,'' His wife yelled, &quot;you are purposely getting fatter, so I'll divorce you, but it's not going to work!&quot; The angry statement stole 
<br>
 the wind from the coach's big-bellied sails. He'd been busted, and for the moment felt as foolish as a school boy caught in a lie. Then suddenly, the scale beneath 
<br>
 him began to rumble. Something caused his weight to balloon even higher! He looked down over the front of his burgeoning belly to see that he was now up to the 
<br>
 three-eighty mark. With a mix of delight and disbelief, he wondered what could possibly be causing his enormous growth. He decided to test a theory. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Hey Baby,&quot; he grunted, slapping his belly loudly, &quot; I thought you said you liked me with a big, fat, pot gut!&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;No!&quot; came the icey answer from the other side of the bathroom door. There was a moment of silence, and coach once again began to swell. He peered over his 
<br>
 belly in time to see his weight reach a whopping four hundred pounds. A deep roaring belly laugh rose from the depths of his huge weighty gut. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;But Pumpkin,&quot; he chuckled, &quot; I thought you said you liked having a BIG, FAT, grizzly roaming around the house!&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;NO!&quot; his wife screamed in reply, &quot;no no no no no no no no no no no!&quot; The scale began to bend. Coach careened forward, grabbing the sides of the pedestal sink 
<br>
 as his already massive gut began swelling like a beachball. He glanced over his shoulder, and caught sight of his rump in the mirror on the opposite wall. He 
<br>
 watched his great meaty buttcheeks widen magnificently, stretching his big supporter to enormous proportions. The big waistband on the jockstrap folded over 
<br>
 onto itself becoming buried under a massive belly that overlapped his thighs and surrounded his middle like an fullblown truck tire. He pulled himself upright, and 
<br>
 began laughing again as he grabbed his beefy hands around lovehandles as large as footballs. Outside the bathroom, he heard his wife's abrupt and steamy retreat 
<br>
 back to the kitchen. 
<br>

<br>
 Coach shifted his weight first to one side, and then the other. His mammoth gut rocked and bounced to and fro. He caught the scale with the heal of his foot, and 
<br>
 sent it skidding across the floor. He now weighed far more than a mere bathroom scale could hold. Throwing back his huge shoulders for balance, he emerged 
<br>
 from the bathroom, gut first, and lumbered ponderously toward the wall-size mirror in the bedroom. He could hardly wait to see the full panoranic view of his new 
<br>
 colossal bulk. 
<br>

<br>
 Coach's eyes widened as he caught the first glimpse of himself in the bedroom mirror. He let the palms of his hands slide down to the underside of his mammoth 
<br>
 gut, playfully slapping the huge ball of fat as he turned profile. Then he cradled the great mound with his hands and forearms and gently hoisted the enormous weight 
<br>
 of it, hefting it up and down like a giant sack of flour. He turned to admire a rump that was nearly a yard wide, and watched his huge beefy thighs shake as he 
<br>
 moved. He flexed his great meaty biceps, each over twenty inches around, and ran a hand around the firm fat melons that had become his chest. He had met up 
<br>
 with old teammates who had let themselves go, and knew one lineman who had gained a tractor tire gut after years of driving a big cross-country rig. Tom had 
<br>
 always wondered how it would feel hauling a gut that big, and now he knew. He squatted slightly, and stroked the hefty bulge that was expanding in the pouch on 
<br>
 his big jock. 
<br>

<br>
 Sometime later, coach paraded himself down to the living room and flung his tremendous bulk into a recliner. The arm rests creaked loudly, stretching to contain his 
<br>
 broad backside. He leaned back, and rubbed his big belly mound happily. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;I'll be eating dinner in front of the TV tonight Honey!&quot; he roared, loud enough for Mona to hear him in the kitchen. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Oh no you won't!&quot; she yelled back. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Oh yes I will,&quot; Tom commanded, &quot;I'm going to sit here in front of the TV and eat all night long.&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;You will not!&quot; she screamed. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;But Babycakes,&quot; shouted coach, winding up for the zinger, &quot; I thought you said you wanted to see me get as big as a house!&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;NO!&quot; came the screech from the kitchen, &quot;no no no no no no no no no no no no no!&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 Coach braced himself as his belly began spreading forward over the top of his thighs, and the chair frame began to groan under his weight.</p>
