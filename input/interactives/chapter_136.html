<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Frank ran back into his room and immediately locked the door behind him. &quot;What the fuck is going on?!&quot; thought Frank. He slowly walked up to the mirror and gazed
<br>
 at the stranger facing him. Frank managed to change Pierce by accidently willing power onto him. But he had never willed himself to become a skinny teenager. This
<br>
 was just too bizzare. Maybe he could make it happen again. 
<br>
 Frank looked around the room for something to inspire him. His eyes landed on a plant that one of the countless women he had bagged in his former life sent him. It
<br>
 was worn, whithered, and neglected. Frank stared at the plant and thought about how it would look if it was healthy again. And with that the plant began to spring up to
<br>
 life. Its worn leaves turn green and its stem perked upward again. &quot;Shit...&quot; said Frank outloud. 
<br>
 Immediately Frank swung back around to the mirror and looked at his new body. &quot;Alright, let's see what we can do here!&quot; Frank liked his new face, although it wasn't
<br>
 quite as mature as he would have liked it to be. &quot;We're gonna need some sideburns here, and stubble too.&quot; With that Frank's face changed slightly. Sideburns creeped
<br>
 down his face. It felt prickly having hundreds of little hairs grow on Frank's face. His jawline was now darker than it had been a minute before. &quot;Feels like sandpaper&quot;
<br>
 said Frank as he rubbed his face. 
<br>
 &quot;Time for some other modifications.&quot; By now Frank had another raging hardon. This whole process of changing himself piece by piece had him very hot. &quot;Let's get
<br>
 these shoulders a little wider. I want to gain about 20 pounds of muscle all around.&quot; Frank's frame filled out. A definate distinction appeared on his shoulders. His pecs
<br>
 pushed outward and raised up. He could actually feel his pecs pop out as he put his had on his chest. He ran his fingers down the little bit of clevage between each
<br>
 pec. His thighs and calfs also plumped out nicely. He may have only been 17 or 18 but he could definately pass for 21 or 22 now. 
<br>
 &quot;And just a bit more hair.&quot; As he said that Frank's chest grew hair all over it. On his stomach a trail creeped down into his boxers. The trail widened out until it covered
<br>
 his entire abdomen. Up top the hair stopped just below his neck. &quot;Damn! I'm a fucking animal!&quot; exclaimed Frank. He then pulled down his boxers and started stroking.
<br>
 He could feel he was about to cum but then he thought of something else that would be absolutely amazing. 
<br>
 Frank stopped jacking and ran into his closet and threw on his fatigues. They were still pretty baggy in his new body. But that wouldn't last long. Frank got back in
<br>
 front of the mirror and watched as he began to get bigger and bigger. His muscles were filling out and he was getting taller too. Even his hands and feet were
<br>
 expanding. His fatigues got tighter and tighter. Frank was rubbing his crotch as he watched all this. When he got to the point where he couldn't stand the feeling of
<br>
 these tight clothes suddenly there was some relief. The sound of seems ripping filled the room. First his shirt split right down the armpits. He moved his arms forward
<br>
 and cut the shirt right down the middle of the back. Frank's left hand caressed his chest, his fingers running through his own chest hair, while his left hand grabbed and
<br>
 pulled at his crotch. His pants then split at the waist. He ripped them away from his legs. He was growing 6'7&quot; - 6'8&quot; - 6'9&quot; - 6'10&quot; - 6'11&quot; - 7' - 7'1&quot; - 7'2&quot; He couldn't
<br>
 believe how tall he was, he grabbed his pec tightly and squeezed as hard as he could. He could feel his chest hair being pulled by his fingers. It hurt, he jacked his now
<br>
 12&quot; cock harder and harder and suddenly he burst. Cum flew out of his body and onto his mirror, onto the floor, onto his hands. Frank moaned so loudly anyone could
<br>
 have heard him. He fell back onto his bed panting and panting, eyes rolled back in his hed barely able to think. Pleasure filled his whole body. He was now 7'7&quot; and
<br>
 nearly 375 pounds. He still looked like a 21 year old but a massive one. &quot;Fuck this is great!&quot; thought Frank. And then he passed out.</p>
