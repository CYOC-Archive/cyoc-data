<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">No fumes - in fact, no nothing. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Damn,&quot; Jessica thought. &quot;Maybe I didn't mix it enough.&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 She screwed a lid tight onto the jar and shook it vigorously. A handful of bubbles desultorily rose to the top of the liquid, but still, not smoke, no fumes. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Are you sure this is the right mixture?&quot; Jessica asked her now-infant husband. 
<br>

<br>
 As best he could, Rick nodded and attempted to shrug his shoulders, to indicate that he was - pretty - sure, but certainly not 100%. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Ooh, you're not going to be any help in THAT condition,&quot; Jessica snorted. &quot;Well, someone's going to have to test this out. It's the only way to begin to reverse
<br>
 your change so you can brew up a version that we can control and sell!&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 She carefully unscrewed the lid and lifted one edge off the jar, then, using a clean eyedropper, sucked an ounce or two of the liquid up and screwed the lid back
<br>
 on. 
<br>

<br>
 Grabbing a nearby glass, she emptied the eyedropper into it, then, balancing Rick on her hip, started upstairs to the kitchen, carrying the glass in her free hand. 
<br>

<br>
 Once upstairs, she put the glass on the counter and stopped to think, unconsciously rocking rick up and down on her hip. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Who, who?&quot; she mused. Perhaps the old man next door. Or maybe my friend Sally - she'd certainly be surprised to see her surgically altered physique returned to
<br>
 'au naturel.' Jessica grinned widely at THAT thought. She picked up the book of friend's and relative's phone numbers from the shelf next to the wall phone, then
<br>
 sat at the table, placing Rick squarely in the center of the tabletop, and began leafing through the pages. 
<br>

<br>
 She failed to notice when Brandon came in. He smiled at his Dad and held up a 'shush' finger to his lips as he stepped to the refrigerator to find a soda. 
<br>

<br>
 Rick stared desperately at his son, trying to communicate his predicament and what Jessica had already done. 
<br>

<br>
 Brandon interpreted this as normal baby play, and made faces back at his Dad as he poured the soda into the nearest glass (brandon thought his Dad seemed to be
<br>
 really into this game, rocking his head back and forth, eyes wide, making 'nuh -nuh' sounds), replaced the bottle and drank deeply. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Ah, that was what I needed,&quot; he said aloud, smacking his lips. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Huh? Oh, Brandon. I oidn't hear you come in,&quot; Jessica began, then noticed the glass her teenage sone was holding. &quot;Bran-- don! You didn't drink from THAT
<br>
 glass, did you? That's the one I put the -- oh, crap on a cracker!&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Um, what, Mom?&quot; Brandon responded. &quot;What, was this your drink? Sorry, I guess I wasn't paying attention. Dad was making faces at me and I was goofing
<br>
 around with him.&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;No, my son, my sometimes idiotic, head-in-the-clouds but I still love him dearly, son,&quot; Jessica said tartly. &quot;That glass had some of the formula your Dad showed
<br>
 me how to mix in it. I was trying to figure out a way to test it, and ....&quot; The sentence drifted off. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;WHAT? Shee-yit!&quot; Brandon expoloded. &quot;So I'm going to be - like Dad?&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Now, Brandon, we don't know for sure that that's what will happen. And, even if it does, that's GOOD!&quot; Jessica began. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Good?&quot; Brandon asked. &quot;How can it be freakin' GOOD to be a freakin' BABY again? Hell, I haven't had the chance to even be a MAN yet!&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 Jessica, ever the voice of reason in a family crisis, tried to calm her son. &quot;Now, now. Nothing's happened yet, has it? And, even if it does, all that means is that the
<br>
 formula is right - or at least close - so I can start on an antidote and then your father and I can work out a way top control and hopefully market this stuff. Think
<br>
 about that for a minute, young man.&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 The word 'young' triggered more panic. &quot;Oh,man, how young do I look now?&quot; Brandon pleaded, patting himself on the chest and stomach to check for anything
<br>
 odd. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Honestly, I don't see any change at all,&quot; Jessica said calmly. &quot;Come here and let me get a good look at you.&quot; &quot;Dammit - must be the wrong mix,&quot; she thought to
<br>
 herself, and cast an angry glance towards Rick, who was busy poking one chubby finger into his belly button, intently watching it go in and out. 
<br>

<br>
 Rick shuffled across the floor. Jessica stood up. &quot;There, you see?&quot; she said, &quot;You're still taller than me, and still my handsome son, just like always. Take a look for
<br>
 yourself, if you don't believe me.&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Yes'm,&quot; Brandon said softly, and loped off to the nearest bathroom, where he planted his fingers over the edge of the sink, bent over, arms locked straight, and
<br>
 stared hard enough to bore holes through the mirror above. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Well, my OTHER little man,&quot; Jessica began, picking up her husband, &quot;We're just going to have to go back downstairs and keep at this until we get it right. Why,
<br>
 oh why can't you learn to keep decent notes as you play around down there, hmm - hmm?&quot; She cooed as she rubbed her nose against baby Rick's. 
<br>

<br>
 Ten minutes later, still clutching the sink and staring at every pore in his reflection, Brandon decided that maybe nothing was going to change. He looked exactly the
<br>
 same. In fact, this whole thing was kind of silly, and he was getting bored. He stuck his tongue out and began to make faces, laughing at his reflection doing the
<br>
 same, then he skipped out of the bathroom. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Mom? Mommy?&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 Jessica, in the basement lab, didn't hear the voice at first. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Mommm-meeee!&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Brandon? Is that you? I'm down here, sweetie. What is it? Mommy's kind of busy right now.&quot; she answered, distractedly. 
<br>

<br>
 Then it clicked. &quot;'Mommy?' Brandon hadn't called her that for ages. Still, it SOUNDED like Brandon ....&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Come on down here, Brandon. Maybe you can help out,&quot; Jessica shouted. &quot;Now, Rick, we're going to try again. This time I'm going to bring each chemical to
<br>
 you, and you lift your right arm for 'yes' and your left arm for 'no,' OK?&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 Rick was getting very sleepy. He couldn't understand anymore why his wife was nagging him so. All he wanted to do was shut his eyes for a few minutes. 
<br>

<br>
 *KNOCK KNOCK* 
<br>

<br>
 Jessica spun around to the open door. 
<br>

<br>
 There was 18-year-old Brandon, one thumb jammed into his mouth, an anguished look in his eyes, his other arm idly swinging back and forth. And the spreading
<br>
 dark spot on the front of his expensive designer-label pants signalled only one thing - he'd wet himself. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Crap on a cracker!&quot; Jessica exploded, shaking her head in disbelief.</p>
