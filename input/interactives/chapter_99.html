<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">They all stood there in silence, each one looking at the other one and than back down at there own changed bodys, they 
<br>
 were all in a state of both shock and denile over what they now looked like. &quot;Well its settled then you all know what you 
<br>
 have to do so lets get this day over with shall we.&quot; Ty said with a grin and he happely left tham to them selves Mark 
<br>
 looked over at his now fat wife, and then to his now skinny son and lowered his head in shame. 
<br>

<br>
 June borck the silence, &quot;We have to do as he says I dont want us to stay like this!&quot; she said almost crying. &quot;Im not 
<br>
 going to work like this June Im a freak! What are the guys going to say when they see me! DAMB IT!!&quot; Mark said as he walked 
<br>
 out of the kitchen and back to the big mirror for a better look at what he looked like now. &quot;NO FUCKIN WAY AM I GOING TO 
<br>
 WORK LIKE THIS FUCK THAT SHIT JUNE IT AINT HAPPENING!!! NONE OF THIS IS IT CANT BE!!&quot; Mark screamed at the top of his 
<br>
 lungs, he was both frustrated and angry at what Ty had done to him. 
<br>

<br>
 Ty had heard him yelling and wondered back into the living room, &quot;You'll do what I tell you to Mark! or would you rather 
<br>
 I do something else to that skinny body!&quot; Ty said concentrating on Mark again, Mark soon felt like he was shrinking or 
<br>
 something and quickly looked at his reflection in the mirror to see what was happening to him, he was shrinking but that 
<br>
 wasent all he was getting younger as well, the clothes that Ty had modified to fit his now skinny 6'2&quot; 110lbs body were 
<br>
 rapidly getting to big for him again as he got ever younger, Mark watched as his facail hair disapeard from his face and 
<br>
 his face took on the look of a preteens he was now forced to once again hold up the size 28-34 jeans,&quot;NO PLEASE TY NOT THIS 
<br>
 IM A MAN NOT A BOY PLEAS!! NO!! STOP THIS ILL GO TO WORK!!&quot; Mark said loudly as his voice cracked back to that of a kids 
<br>
 tone. 
<br>

<br>
 Mark felt himself regaining his old height back as Ty changed him back to his thirty six year old body. He was still to 
<br>
 skinny for his height but he was a man again, Mark shot him a mean glare and grabed his truck keys and started for the 
<br>
 front door, &quot;OH NO YOU DONT MARK!&quot; TY said to him before he got to the door. &quot;WHAT TY!&quot; Mark said as he clinched the keys 
<br>
 tightly in his bony hand. &quot;You have to take me and Dustin to school first we seem to have missed the bus this mourning.&quot; 
<br>
 Ty said calmly to the now furious Mark. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;HEY DUSTIN COME ON DUDE!! SUPER DADS TAKEN US TO SCHOOL LITTLE GUY!!&quot; Ty yelled and then laughed. Dustin came into the 
<br>
 room draging his book bag behind him, &quot;Whats the matter jock boy those books to heavy for you to carry now pussy whimp!&quot; Ty 
<br>
 said as Dustin came in. &quot;Fuck you Ty!&quot; Dustin said as he tryed to lift the bag off the ground, it was now way to heavy for 
<br>
 him to lift and Dustin fought back tears as he tryed to lift it, he couldnt lift it anymore it was way to heavy for his now 
<br>
 pathetically skinny biecepts to lift. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Here give me your bag ya whimp Ill carry it for your skinny ass! lets go!&quot; Ty said as he grabed the bag and easly 
<br>
 lifted it up and followed the now rail thin Mark to his truck, Dustin just held his head low and followed them to the 
<br>
 truck, thoughts of how strong he use to be ran through his mind, he was so proud of the fact that his biecepts were 17 
<br>
 inches around just friday and now they werent even 5 inches he couldnt even lift his own school books anymore. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Well climb in sport your the middle guy now squirt, not me anymore little guy! ITS YOU! And just think Dustin your gonna 
<br>
 be the skinnyest guy at school now! just think of what all the guys ya hang with will think of the mighty Dustin now! Not 
<br>
 to even think of what the girls are gonna think aye Dust!&quot; Ty said with a wink. Dustins eyes were welling up with tears as 
<br>
 he reluctantly climbed into the truck, and looked over at his now pencil thin dad, he sniffled as he sat there and Ty was 
<br>
 enjoying it all. 
<br>

<br>
 They got to the school at about the same time as the buses so Ty knew they were going to hear some shit as the students 
<br>
 got a look at Dustins new look. Ty looked at Dustin to see his reaction to the crowd they were about to mingle into &quot;You 
<br>
 know something Dust? You still have that good lookin face to fall back on ya know! I mean just cause your a skinny tall 
<br>
 bean pole doesent mean its the end of your life dude!&quot; Ty said with a smile, Dustin did still have a good looking face, 
<br>
 sure it was skinny and his cheek bones showed more than before, but he was still handsom looking for a skinny guy. And so 
<br>
 was his now skinny dad as well, &quot;You know something guys I got just one more change for you two to go through!&quot; Ty said 
<br>
 with a bit of exitement to his voice. &quot;No more changes, please Ty dont change me anymore please!!&quot; Dustin pleaded to Ty. 
<br>
 &quot;NO JUST ONE MORE THING I THINK YOU'LL BOTH LOVE THIS ONE!! Ty said loudly and with a great big grin. 
<br>

<br>
 Dustin didnt know what he had in mind what more could he do to them that he hadent already done, Mark was thinking along 
<br>
 the same lines as Dustin was what more could Ty do to them. Then they both began to feel their teeth begin to grow and 
<br>
 Marks nose began to get bigger and he could feel his lower lip that was the thick pouty type that made him iresistable to 
<br>
 the ladys, begin to thin and become weak as did his strong chin and jaw line. Poor Dustin who had the same charming good 
<br>
 features as his dad also felt his lower lip and chin grow smaller and thinner as his front top teeth protruded out from his 
<br>
 upper lip, both guys now looked like sterio typical nerds now, Ty concentrated hard and they each got big bottle thick 
<br>
 glasses to esentuate the look, Ty fixed it so they couldnt see with out the glasses and then told them to see what they 
<br>
 looked like for them selves Ty was quite pleased with the results. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;I CANT GO TO WORK LOOKING LIKE THIS TY THEY'LL FIRE ME I LOOK LIKE A GEEK!!&quot; Mark screamed at Ty. &quot;That you do Mark ya 
<br>
 do look like a geek!&quot; Ty said laughing. he then opened the trucks door and got out, he reached in and draged poor geeky 
<br>
 Dustin out of the truck and waved goodbye to Mark, Mark sat there for a minute and Ty just staired at him angerly, Mark 
<br>
 again felt himself shrinking down again and imedieatly gun the engine and started away, he felt himself growing back up as 
<br>
 he drove off looking like the super tall skinny geek that he now was.</p>
